 ABOUT
 
 The spellcorrection class implements an application that 
 offers a suggestion for a misspelled word.
 
 BACKGROUND
 
 This program uses Peter Norvig's list of word counts based on 
 the noisy channel model of spelling. This model has a 80 to 90% accuracy 
 rate for spelling correction.
 
 
 TODO
 
 - Computing error probability using a confusion matrix for single edit spelling errors.  
 - Using word segmentation for more detailed spelling checks using sentence analysis.
